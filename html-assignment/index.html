        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello, My name is <strong> Anna Bimm </strong>, I was born in <strong> Kazakstahn, Almaty </strong>on August 1<sup>st</sup>, and i had got left at a neighborhood park as a baby. I got adopted by my Mom, and she flew me back to Canada and I became a citizen. 
            I had found out about 2 years ago that I have a half brother, Joshua who had also been adopted and lives in Conneticut.  
         </p>
         <p> I have two dogs, Chunky and Lola- they are mini golden doodles and I enjoy going on walks with them at a local forest we goto. I love playing sports, like basketball, track and field, and football. 
            I had played a lot of competitive basketball during highschool and I still play at Algonquin College.   </p>
